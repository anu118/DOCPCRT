<h3><i class="icon icon-users"></i> Group Discussion:</h3>
<p>Now a days Group Discussion is being extensively used along with personal interviews for the final selection of candidates. 
It plays a main role in selecting the best among the best. 
It becomes necessary to conduct further screening after aptitude for choosing a few among many. 
It is one of the best tools to study the behavioral and attitudinal responses of the participants.
Rightly speaking, Group Discussion is more a technique than a conventional test.
In fact, it is one of the most important and popular techniques being used in a number of personality tests. 
It is a technique or a method used for screening candidates as well as testing their potential. 
It is also designed as a situation test wherein a sample of a candidate’s group worthiness and potential as a worker comes out quite explicitly</p>
<h4>Checks you for:</h4>
<ul style="color: #fff;">
<li>Communication Skills – key ingredient</li>
<li>Team skills – how you manage and engage people</li>
<li>Analytical skills</li>
<li>General knowledge</li>
<li>Self Confidence</li>
</ul>

<h3><i class="icon-speech-bubble"></i> Personal Interview:</h3>
<p>The PI is often a test of a student’s motivation, passion, curiosity, ability to react creatively to situations, handle stress etc.</p>
<p>The two kinds of interviews one sees are the HR Interview and the Technical Interview. Some companies conduct both separately.</p>
<p>The major areas of PI questions that will be touched upon:</p>
<ul style="color: #fff;">
<li>CV take-off questions</li>
<li>Subject Related questions (technical interview)</li>
<li>HR questions</li>
<li>Current Affairs</li>
<li>Company related questions</li>
<li>Case-based questions</li>
<li>Different Interviews: Standard, Behavioural</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<h3><i class="icon-paper"></i> Technical:</h3>
<p>Technical interviews are common amongst employers recruiting for engineering, science or I.T. roles.
 Essentially, it’s an interview to assess the candidates technical ability, usually related to the technical knowledge required for the role and the organisation the candidate wish to work for.</p>
<p>The recruiter will be assessing the extent of the technical knowledge. This will be the knowledge base required to thrive in the job, as well as an understanding and interest in different technologies and the industry. They might also test how the candidate practically apply the knowledge to real working situations.</p>

<hr>

<h3><i class="icon-paper"></i> Resume Writing:</h3>
<p>First impressions count, and the first impression that a potential employer will have about the candidate is going to depend on how the candidate will present the resume. This is going to be the one and only chance to capture a potential employer’s attention, or for the resume to be tossed into the file of those they don’t want to pursue.</p>
<p>The statistics are that the average employer only spends a few seconds looking at a resume, so it is imperative that it makes an impression. In this increasingly competitive job market, the candidate need to have a professional resume that contains the right information, so that it will stand out amongst the countless other resumes that potential employers will be looking at, and give the best possible chance of getting their attention. The candidate need to remember that it have few seconds that the potential employer is going to be taking to glance at the resume, so it’s very important to make sure that all the years which have been working and studying are going to be represented properly in the resume.</p>
